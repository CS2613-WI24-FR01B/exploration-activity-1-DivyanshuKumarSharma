Plot Summary: ['The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.', 'The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the 
head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter\'s wedding. Michael, Vito\'s youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the 
wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against 
those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don\'s influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito\'s fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.—srijanarora-152-448595', 'Michael, the young and idealistic son of Vito Corleone, the head of the most powerful Mafia clan in New York, returns home as a war hero and is determined to live his own life. But tragic circumstances make him face the legacy of his family.—fiveisforsecret', 'The story begins as "Don" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia "family", oversees his daughter\'s wedding with his wife Carmela. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father\'s business. Through Michael\'s life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life 
in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don\'t want to follow the old ways and look out for community and "family". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don\'s influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don\'s fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family.—Charlie Ness', "Vito Corleone is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest 
son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.—TheElfstone"]
